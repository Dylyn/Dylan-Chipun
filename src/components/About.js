          Hi, I'm Dylan, a fifth-year Computing student at Queen's University with a passion for software development. 
          I love solving complex problems and building innovative solutions, whether it's through coding, creative designs, 
          or exploring new ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
          I have experience working as a software developer at RBC and will be returning as a new graduate in 2025â€“2026. 
          My time in both academic and professional settings has strengthened my ability to think critically, adapt quickly,
           and collaborate effectively.
          </p>
          <p>Beyond technical skills, I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges. Whether it's diving into 
            new technologies or refining my skills, I'm committed to continuous growth.
